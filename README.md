# Connect 4 - CS112 project

## About:
In this project, we worked on creating the computer player to play against an actual person. All work done for this project is in Player.java. In this file we call a function called "minMax" which is able to determine which is the best move to make using alpha beta pruning. The value of the move is determined by using helper methods such as "score". 

## How to run:
To play the game run:
'''
